# Lottery-DrawNumbers
In this web app, I created a index.html and put dependencies on my pom.xml.
I created a Web app that, given a number of balls and a max Range of Lottery Numbers, you can see the result of a computer-generated lottery drawing. For example, if you put in 6 for numBalls (variable for number of Lottery Balls) and 100 for MaxNum (variable for Maximum Range of the Lottery),  you can see a result like this. (in 'results.jsp')
